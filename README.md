### Setup

- Use a python virtualenv  `python3 -m venv Venv`
- `https://github.com/Vatsalparsaniya/Yolo-Segmentation-Chess.git`
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Run locally

- start app using `python3 main.py` and open app on your phone with your maching ip and `5000` port-number ex. `https://192.168.4.67:5000/`
- make sure you use `https` instead of `http`. 
- Since I'm using locally produced SSL certificates, the risk warning will appear, but you can overlook it.
- grant camera permissions.
